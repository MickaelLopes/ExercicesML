# Markov Chain - Word and Sentences generation  
This exercices is based on the English and French bigram matrix. 
For information, a bigram matrix is a matrix giving the probabily of two adjacents elements, meaning , it is a matrix giving the probability of the next elements knowing the current element. 
For our exercices, the French and English bigram matrix, give us the probability of the next character knowing the current character. 

The exercices can be split in 3 part : 
## Part 1 : Word creation 
Given the bi-gram for English language, we will first create a function to create a random word

## Part 2 : Sentence creation 
We will extend the function and the bigram to create a random sentence.

## Part 3 : Language recognition
Finaly, we will create a function (based on the English and French bigram) to test if a sentence if more 'likely' to be a French or english.
